        This is an android application that will help you improve different kinds of worship for you by tracking them.\n\n

This application will make it easy for you to set goals on your worships.\n\n

Lets say, you aim to say SubhanaAllah 1000 times everyday, it might look like a lot but if you break it down to 100 times before and after each prayer, it takes around 5 minutes for the 200 times total. This is just an example you can plan according to your own schedule.\n\n

Each time you complete saying SubhanaAllah you record it to the application, at the end of the day you will be able to see your progress.\n\n

You can do this to other kinds of worship like reading Quran or other religious books.\n\n

These are the worships you can track.\n\n

1. Adhkar (Dhikr)\n
2. Fasting\n
3. Prayers\n
4. Reading\n
5. Writing\n
6. Listening\n\n

The aim of the application is to help you be consistent in your worship by setting daily, weekly or monthly goals.\n\n
        You will be surprised with how much you can accomplish with as little as 5 minutes of your time. The rewards of it in the Hereafter are great InshaAllah.\n\n</string>

    <string name="support_text">We need you help to improve the application.\n\n

If you have any issues, bugs or advice,\n\n Please feel free to send an email to neatfaith@gmail.com.</string>

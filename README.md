This is an android application that will help you improve different kinds of worship for you by tracking them. 
Using this app you can track these kinds of worship(ibada)

| No. | Worship |
|---|---|
| 1 | Adhkar (Dhikr) |
| 2 | Fasting |
| 3 | Prayers |
| 4 | Reading |
| 5 | Writing |
| 6 | Listening |


The aim of this application is for those who set daily,weekly or monthly goals to track their progress easily.

For example, if someone wishes to say SubhanaAllah 1000 times every day. It might look like a lot but if you break it down to 100 times before and after each prayer or according to your own convinience it becomes easy. So each time you finish the 100 times you log them into the application. At the end of the day you can see what you have done.

This applies to other kinds of worship also like reading Quran or any other religious books and so on.
